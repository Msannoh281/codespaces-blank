#organize multiple forms of data.

# we create lists using the square brackets and assigning it to variable.
example == [1,2,3,4,5,6, 'name','dob','year',True,[1,2,3,4, False, 1.2]]


# We use list to structure data in large applications.

 videos = ['cat video', 'music video','dacning video']

# we can manipulate lists to add, remove, sort, etc.

 video.append("coding video")

# creat a function that will add a seasoning to list a food seasoings.
# Your functions should take in a user input, and should use the append() functions
# to add the season to the seasoning list,
